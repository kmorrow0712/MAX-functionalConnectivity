## Paradigm set-up

## How does this relate to the cerebellum?

The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in a multitude of threat and fear-related paradigms and pathologies (e.g., anxiety, specific phobia, autism, schizophrenia, the list goes on and on). With at least 30 structural subdivisions, different pieces of the cerebellum contribute to different types of emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor functions. Given the variety of functions that the cerebellum plays a role in, it is no surprise that it shares structural and functional connections with the prefrontal cortex and limbic regions.

There is not much research regarding how the cerebellum may respond during sustained periods of threat and what other threat-related regions that it may share functional connectivity with during sustained threat.

It seems likely that portions of the cerebellum would respond in a sustained manner to sustained threat as it is implicated in generalized anxiety disorder, high arousal states, and greater responses to uncontrollable versus controllable aversive stimuli. However, it is entirely possible that some subregions of the cerebellum may respond more transiently. Because this is an under-explored area, I think it is best to go in with no set beliefs of the temporal response to sustained threat.

## Questions to answer and how to address

1. What sub-regions of the cerebellum show sustained responses to threat? Which show transient responses?

I have a weird idea to get estimated responses in the entire cerebellum and then group based on the shape of the response. Perhaps that is too reliant on the data, though.

2. Do these regions show differences in functional conenectivity?

## Important considerations
If looking at small areas like the fastigial and dentate nucleus, might be best to use unsmoothed data.
