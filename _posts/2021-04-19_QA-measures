## Foray in fMRI quality assessments
There are many structural and functional quality measures (often called image quality metrics or IQMs) for functional MRI data. Most of these measures are **no reference metrics**, meaning that there is no ground truth in what a value *should* be. 

For instance, how do you know if your dataset is "good"? Could it be that all of your datapoints are clustered, thus seemingly OK, but are actually bad metric values? 

`MRIQA` provides great visualization of a multitude of metrics, but it can be tough to answer these questions by just looking. Looking is subjective!

Thus, I am seeking ways to better quantify these so-called no reference metrics.

### Framewise displacement

**framewise displacement:** timeseries index of overall movement over time. 

Framewise displacement seems to be the mostly common used QA metric for excluding functional data with excessive motion. Oftentimes researchers will use a threshold criteria of FD < 0.2mm and either censor these timepoints or exclude participants if a particular percentage of their data exceed the threshold.

* Assessing framewise displacement is really important for all datasets, but especially functional connectivity studies.

* Should inspect average FD and subject distributions

* Typical thresholds for task fMRI are anywhere between 0.3 and 0.5mm, resting state fMRI typically go for more conservative thresholds (generally 0.2mm)
    * If a participant has 30% of their data over this threshold, it is probably good to exclude their data.
        * Here would be ~ 3 runs.

### GCOR
Calculate the average correlation of each voxel with the global signal. If values are highly positive, likely being very influenced by motion. 

* CONN toolbox is cool because it will show you the distribution of this correlation pre- and post- denoising process. 
* GCOR seen in `mriqc` is before denoising, so may not be grounds for elimination. You cannot determine if data can be "saved" through denoising, but high values are a flag to keep an eye on the data after denoising.
