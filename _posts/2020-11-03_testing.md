## Relevant details

### Dataset
MAX (N = 5) 

### Seed region(s)
**left Crus II (cerebellum)** <br>
`SUIT_l-CrusII_YeoNetwork6_intersect_gm_2mm.nii.gz` <br>

#### Transformations
1. Crus II multipled with [Buckner et al's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3214121/) cognitive control network. 
2. Intersection then multiplied with a [SUIT](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/suit.htm) gray matter mask.  


### Programs utilized 
AFNI 

### Goal
Practice generating general psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) terms to explore functional connectivity between seed regions and all other voxels of the brain and how this relationship relates to task. </br>

### Info
 Scripts and data files are described below. Each step is documented with output images or examples when applicable. Very small group of subjects used with a simple analysis in mind (for now...). <br>
 _All scripts shown are shell script and show typical shell shortcuts e.g., `"$subj"`_

## Extract time series from seed region(s)

#### 1. Extract baseline from first level subject data
First, need to extract the baseline which includes drifts, motion, and motion derivatives as output from `3dDeconvolve` using `3dSynthesize`

``3dSynthesize -cbucket ./MAX"$subj"_Main_block_MR_REML_beta_shockcensored_I.nii.gz 
-matrix ./"MAX"$subj"_Main_block_MR_uncensored_I.x1D" -select baseline -overwrite 
-prefix "$output"/MAX/"$subj"_EP_Main_TR_MNI_2mm_I_denoised_baselineModel.nii.gz``

#### 2. Subtract baseline from preprocessed functional data


```python

```
